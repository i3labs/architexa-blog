We have been extremely frustrated with UML tooling in the past, and for the last 2+ years we have been building something very cool. See the video below:

Where other tools require months of work to get something useful, we want to get you useful results in minutes if not seconds. Some tools require reading lots of documentation to use, but we have wanted a tool that you can get up to speed in 5 minutes.

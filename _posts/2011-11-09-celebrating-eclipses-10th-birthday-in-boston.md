Eclipse is turning 10 years &#8211; and we have been in a mood to celebrate it. We have been involved in a lot of Eclipse related events in the past, but wanted to do something special this year.

If you are in Boston, come join us next week. We will be having free pizza, beer and even a birthday cake. We will have a bunch of people who really know Eclipse inside-out and will be showcasing a bunch of the cool technology being built these days.

Time and Location: We have planned to have the event on **17 November 2011 at 6:30PM**, at Constant Contact, (Reservoir Place, 1601 Trapelo Road, Waltham, MA 02451 &#8211; see on [map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Constant+Contact,+Waltham,+MA&hl=en&ll=42.415219,-71.259212&spn=0.118369,0.173378&sll=42.43638,-71.221619&sspn=0.115289,0.173378&vpsrc=0&hq=Constant+Contact,&hnear=Waltham,+Middlesex,+Massachusetts&t=m&z=13)).

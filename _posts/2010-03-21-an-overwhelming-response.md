<!--S-ButtonZ 1.1.5 End-->

<!--dzoneZ=none--> Over the last two weeks, we here at Architexa have been overwhelmed by the positive response to our vision (see video on our 

[homepage](http://www.architexa.com)). At JavaHispano Abraham [talked](http://javahispano.org/contenidos/es/architexa__un_plugin_de_uml_para_eclipse/) in spanish about (translated)

> &#8230; always liking to use UML to understand and navigate source code that is not mine and that I have to change. Or even my old code that I can not remember exactly how it is organized. However, I have never been able to create a lot of UML diagrams and use them to generate the skeleton code. So my pattern of use of these tools fits well with the philosophy of Architexa. 

He went on to say that 

> The difference with all the [Architexa] tools is that they are designed to &#8220;surf&#8221; the source code through UML diagrams, so that one may be viewing more or less detail as you need. It is not an all or nothing, which is usually the case with\ traditional UML tools. 

A poll trying [to find if developers let their UML/design diagrams go stale](http://java.dzone.com/polls/do-you-let-your-uml-diagrams), recognized that &#8220;sometimes it can be too much work to go back and update diagrams once the coding process is underway, especially when under a tight deadline&#8221;. It found that over 2/3rd developers noticed that with today&#8217;s tools their diagrams go stale with them falling back to their code.

One of the editors at JavaLobby, James Sugrue, did an an interview and talked about [how Architexa makes life easy for developers](http://java.dzone.com/articles/how-architexa-makes-life-easy). He talks about seeing a huge potential in our tool &#8220;for helping out with code reviews, or for getting into a new code base&#8221;.

In the Social Media world, it was nice to be referred to as the next generation of UML tools:

Since exiting the beta, we have been encouraged by the response and are letting people in to use the suite as fast as we can. We want to make sure developers have a great experience with our suite and we want to provide a great level of support while doing that. 

We will be releasing additional videos and information on the product soon in addition to the (hopefully) informative content you&#8217;ve come to expect.

title: Understanding What Others Are Upto!

excerpt: |
  One of the challenges when working in teams is in keeping up with your fellow developers. Spending a lot of time reading others' code not only means less time getting your own work done but also the gradual deterioration of the code architecture. This is a problem that we have heard over and over again from developers and managers alike.
  
  We have just released additional code and architectural review tools that will help developers easily understand new features that are being built. We are pleased to announce that we will be demoing this functionality at EclipseCon 2011 as part of the Hot New Products Showcase. With this release we not only have a full fledged code review client and server, but also are making it really easy for developers to document the main parts of what is being worked on. Our new features will help developers create and maintain more comprehensive architectural documentation, solving a number of common development issues.
  
  It's important to make sure the quality of your project's code and documentation don't degrade over time. Reviewing the architecture as well as the code itself will ensure a better documented codebase, resulting in easier to understand code and decreased development overhead.
  
  On the other hand, we all know that poorly documented code can increase overhead. Developers are often biased to think that their own code is well documented. Another set of eyes checking the documentation as well as the code can make sure confusing code is documented before it is committed.
  
  Code duplication is one of the main sources of bugs and headaches for developers. Code review can help minimize duplication in new code but finding redundancies in legacy code may be difficult without quality architectural documentation.
  
  Projects with limited or outdated architectural documentation are more susceptible to code erosion since developers may not be clear on what boundaries they are constrained by. Easy access to viewing and creating documentation helps developers be more aware of the effects their code has on other components.

Spending a lot of time reading others&#8217; code not only means less time getting your own work done but also the gradual deterioration of the code architecture. This is a problem that we have heard over and over again from developers and managers alike.

We have just released additional [code and architectural review tools](http://www.architexa.com/learn-more/code-review) that will help developers easily understand new features that are being built. We are pleased to announce that we will be demoing this functionality at [EclipseCon 2011](http://www.eclipsecon.org) as part of the Hot New Products Showcase. With this release we not only have a full fledged code review client and server, but also are making it really easy for developers to document the main parts of what is being worked on.

### Architexa will enable:

**Easier code reviews before code-commits:** Ever found yourself under pressure to get a feature built, but worried that it was tightly coupled with a critical component? We have made sure that the Architexa suite allows you to to create a diagram of any outgoing changes straight from the synchronize view or the Team context menu. You can now create a diagram to explain the main ideas and invite a team lead to point out any potential problems before the code is committed.

**Simplified reviewing for already checked-in code:** Have you ever felt that you need to understand what some recently checked in code does? We have added capabilities in Architexa to allow you to select any number of revisions from Eclipse&#8217;s History right click to automatically build a diagram based on the code commits.

**Faster documentation of changes and new components:** Worried that you are going to be stuck using a poorly documented codebase? Architexa&#8217;s integration into team repositories will allow you to not only easily create up-to-date diagrams of critical code components, but will allow you to save them for collaborative refinement with the rest of the team &#8211; so that they can be easily found later. Such diagrams are shown to users later when they select any affected parts of the code.

[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-341" title="CodeMaps" src="assets/uploads/2012/04/CodeMapsShot1.png" alt="" width="150" height="35" />](assets/uploads/2012/04/CodeMapsShot1.png)As we mentioned in out last post we have been working on a site to help Java Developers use Open Source Projects. The site is in an early stage but we want to work on the site openly and improve it with your feedback.

Out goal is to help you use an Open Source Project. We want to help you easily look at the API&#8217;s/Javadoc; Make it easy to get a code snippet for using a feature in a library; Simplify finding the right blog post; And even get you a high-level view of the project.

Yes, it&#8217;s a big goal, but we feel like there is so much that can be done to make out lives as coders easier. We hope this is a good first step in the right direction.

Check out the site: [http://CodeMaps.org](http://www.codemaps.org). If you can&#8217;t find your favorite project we can help! Click the &#8216;Add Project&#8217; button on the top, and our engine will import the project for you to view. 

Oh yeah, make sure to let us know what you think. We want CodeMaps to grow into something that you use want to tell your friends about!

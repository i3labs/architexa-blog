<!--dzoneZ=none-->Here at Architexa, we have been hard at work on an exciting new vision – one that we believe will make our lives as software developers much easier. As our software has grown into a powerful suite of developer tools, we have been wanting to share our ideas with you, and also hear what you think about what we’re doing. We decided to launch this blog so we can better communicate with YOU: the software developers who inspire our work! Check in frequently to see what we’re up to. Your feedback is really important for what we do, so tell us what you think: what you like, what you don’t like, and where you think we should be headed. Also let us know if you have any tips that other developers might benefit from – we will put them up.

Welcome to Architexa blog! We look forward to connecting with you!
